This directory contains installed big data drivers to be used by the Pentaho server.
If you want the Pentaho server to read them from the default location, please copy the driver Kar files to this directory.
If you would like the Pentaho server to read the files from a different location, copy the driver Kar files to the desired location and change the value of
the SHIM_DRIVER_DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION property within the kettle.properties file to the full path of the location where the Kar files were placed.
